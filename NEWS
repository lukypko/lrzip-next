With the inclusion of the LZMA2 reduced dictionary size set, the
possibility for including more details in the magic header is there.
For example, the current LZMA encoding block is 5 bytes. 1 byte for
lc, lp, and pb, and 4 bytes for Dictionary Size. The LZMA2 standard
uses only 2 bytes. 1 byte for lc, lp, and pb, and 1 byte for
Dictionary Size which is encoded as 0 to 40. This will leave three
bytes for storing additional compression details.

Some possibilities are ZPAQ Block sizes, Compression Level setting,
Memory settings such as Compression Window, Memory Overhead, Rzip
Compression Level, etc.

More on this later as these items are evaluated.
